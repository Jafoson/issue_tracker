// ─── RBAC: system roles ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The default roles exist **exactly once each** in the database — with no
// binding to a workspace or a project. All tenants point at the same rows.
// This keeps the database free of copies and makes a change to a default
// role take effect everywhere at once.
//
// The deliberate cost: a system role isn't editable. Anyone who needs
// "Member, but without labels" creates a new role in their own workspace
// (`role.manage`) — that one then belongs to the workspace or the project.
//
// `scope` says where a role may be granted; `rank` models the hierarchy
// within a scope and drives the "at most your own role can be assigned"
// rule.
//
// Each context resolves exactly one role: the project role in a project, the
// workspace role in a workspace, the platform role on the platform. That's
// why a workspace role no longer carries any issue or comment permissions —
// the registry simply doesn't allow that in scope WORKSPACE. Whoever needs
// to reach into their workspace's projects gets `project.admin.all` for
// that. The evaluation lives in `lib/permissions.ts`.
//
// A role only ever lists what it allows. There's no opposite: since each
// context resolves exactly one role, "not listed" already is the denial.
