// ─── RBAC: permission registry ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Pure data definition — no DB access, no `server-only`, no Prisma imports.
// This file is imported by the runtime (lib/permissions.ts), by the seed
// (prisma/seed.ts), by provisioning (lib/rbac-provision.ts), and by the
// tests.
//
// A permission key names **object and action** — not the level. Where a
// permission takes effect is decided by the scope of the role that carries
// it:
//
//   label.create on a workspace role → labels across the whole workspace
//   label.create on a project role   → labels in that project
//
// That's why each permission records the scopes it may be granted in.
// `workspace.delete` on a project role would be meaningless and is blocked.
//
// This list also marks the boundary between the levels. Each context
// resolves **exactly one** role (`lib/permissions.ts`), and `collect()` only
// takes from it what the `scopes` field actually allows it to carry. A
// permission not enabled here for a scope therefore cannot take effect
// there — even if a stale row in `RolePermission` claims otherwise.
//
// Two keys deliberately cross that boundary, and only these two. They're the
// master keys with which one level unlocks the level below:
//
//   tenant.access      (PLATFORM)   → everything in every workspace and project
//   project.admin.all  (WORKSPACE)  → everything in every project of the workspace
//   project.view.all   (WORKSPACE)  → read access to every project of the workspace
//
// They're checked in the resolver before role resolution. That's exactly
// what backs the guarantee that a workspace's leadership can't be locked out
// of any of its projects: a project role is never even loaded for them.
