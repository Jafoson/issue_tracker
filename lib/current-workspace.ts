 * the same segment, Next.js only re-renders the page, the layout stays put
 * and the store would remain empty. That's exactly what made workspace
 * queries in pages fail after a click, while they worked after a reload.
 *
 * Idempotent — setting it multiple times within the same request is harmless.
