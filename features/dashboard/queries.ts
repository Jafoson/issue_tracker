// project that's grown, transfer thousands of rows including their
// descriptions, just to show a dozen numbers in the end. The only queries
// that fetch whole rows are the two lists further down, and those have a
// `take`.
//
// The time axis, by contrast, is built in code (`lib/buckets.ts`): a
// `GROUP BY` only knows buckets that have something in them, and a quiet
// week would otherwise not be a zero but a gap in the chart.
//
// **Permissions.** Everything here hangs off `project.view` — the numbers
// are the project's content, in condensed form. Anyone not allowed to see
// the issues also isn't allowed to know how many there are. As everywhere,
// `null` returns what "doesn't exist for you"; the page turns that into a
// 404, without revealing whether the project is missing or access is.
