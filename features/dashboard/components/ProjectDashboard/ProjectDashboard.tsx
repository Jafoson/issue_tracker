/**
 * A project's home page — in two views.
 *
 * ── Overview or dashboard ──
 *
 * Each answers a different question. The **overview** says what the project
 * is: purpose, prefix, leadership, who has access. That still holds next
 * month too, so it has no time period at all — it's the default. The
 * **dashboard** says how it's currently doing: numbers, trends, what's
 * falling behind. All of that changes hourly and depends on the chosen
 * period.
 *
 * Which of the two is open is remembered by the page
 * (`DashboardPreference.view`): the project row in the sidebar leads here
 * with no `?view=`, and whoever last looked at the numbers doesn't want to
 * call them up again on the next click.
 *
 * They sit side by side as a toggle rather than as two routes, even though
 * settings does it the other way around: there, switching *replaces* the
 * whole area including navigation, here everything stays put and only the
 * cards swap. The data for both comes from a single call anyway
 * (`getProjectDashboard`), so switching costs no server round trip — and
 * `?view=` in the address still makes it shareable and survives a reload.
 *
 * ── The structure ──
 *
 * A row of controls at the top, below it everything they affect — the
 * period applies to every number on this page, not per card. A dashboard
 * where two cards show different weeks isn't an overview, it's a source of
 * errors. In the overview, that row doesn't even appear: period, table view,
 * and "customize" have no business there, and a control with no effect is
 * worse than none at all.
 *
 * The period lives in the address (`?range=30d`) instead of this
 * component's state: that makes it shareable, it survives a reload, and the
 * numbers come fresh from the server. It's additionally recorded on the
 * account — the address carries the period of *this* particular visit, the
 * preference the one the dashboard opens with next time.
 *
 * ── The layout ──
 *
 * Which widgets appear in which order is decided by each person individually
 * (`features/dashboard/widgets.ts`). This component doesn't know that
 * decision, it just reads it: `order` arrives fully resolved from the
 * server, and the loop below renders whatever's in it. An `if` per widget
 * would have hardcoded that same order a second time — and specifically the
 * one written in the source, not the one someone configured.
