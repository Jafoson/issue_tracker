/**
 * Truncates a row to a single line and reports how many children still fit —
 * the caller sums up the rest as "+n".
 *
 * CSS can clip a row (`overflow`), but it can't count what it clipped: there
 * is no selector for "sticks out". So this measures instead — the same
 * exception as in `useTextEnd`, and with the same scope: only a number comes
 * out of it, styling still happens in the stylesheet.
 *
 * Measurement happens exactly once per set of labels, in the pass before
 * anything is truncated — after that, half of them aren't even in the DOM
 * anymore. The widths are therefore cached: if the column gets narrower, the
 * observer keeps recalculating from that cache alone, without having to
 * rebuild the full row first.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { ref, fit } = useRowFit(labels.length, labels.map((l) => l.name).join())
 * const shown = fit === null ? labels : labels.slice(0, fit)
 * ```
 *
 * As long as `fit` is `null`, the measuring pass is running: then *all*
 * children belong in the row, plus the counter at the end, taken out of
 * flow. This state is also the one before hydration and the one without
 * JavaScript — so the row doesn't wrap even when untruncated, it just gets
 * clipped.
