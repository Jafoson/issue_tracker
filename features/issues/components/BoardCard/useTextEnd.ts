/**
 * Measures where a wrapping text ends — the spot where something that
 * belongs to it can attach (here: the pencil icon next to the title).
 *
 * CSS doesn't know this point. A sibling positioned relative to the text's
 * *box* would sit far behind a short final line; positioning it inline in
 * the text flow instead means the line clamp (`-webkit-line-clamp`) would
 * cut it off along with long titles. That leaves measuring — the one
 * exception to "appearance belongs in the stylesheet": the result is just
 * two numbers, positioning still happens in CSS.
 *
 * Lines cut off by the clamp don't count: they lie below the box. So what's
 * measured is the end of the last line that's actually visible — for a
 * truncated title, that's the line with the "…".
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { ref, end } = useTextEnd(title)
 * <p ref={ref}>{title}</p>
 * ```
