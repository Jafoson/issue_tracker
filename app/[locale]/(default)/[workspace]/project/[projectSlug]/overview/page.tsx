/**
 * A project's landing page, in two views: "Overview" with its profile and
 * "Dashboard" with the numbers. Both come from a single call, switching
 * happens client-side — `?view=` in the URL keeps track of the current state.
 *
 * ── Where the time range and view come from ──
 *
 * Both follow the same precedence: URL first, then the account, then the
 * default. That's the right order — a shared link should show what the
 * sender saw, not whatever the recipient once configured for themselves.
 * Without a URL, whatever the person last had open applies: the project row
 * in the sidebar leads exactly here, and whoever last looked at the numbers
 * there doesn't want to set them up again on the next click.
