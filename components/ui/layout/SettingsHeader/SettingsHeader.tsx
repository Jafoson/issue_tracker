 * The topmost row of the settings: the switcher between Personal, Project,
 * and Workspace.
 *
 * It spans across both columns below it — above the scope nav and above the
 * scope itself. That's not cosmetic, it's the hierarchy: the switcher
 * changes both columns at once, so it can't belong to either one. In the nav
 * (208px), there also wasn't room left for a full word for "Personal"; here
 * there's space for both the icon and the label.
 *
 * The row itself sets no bottom edge. The line below it comes from the top
 * edges of the two columns (`SettingsNav`, `PageHeader`) — that way it runs
 * across the full width and stays one line instead of two.
 *
 * Deliberately built from links rather than buttons: each scope has its own
 * address, and a link can be opened in a new tab. That means the row needs
 * no `"use client"` — which scope is active is known by the layout that
 * renders it, not by the browser.
