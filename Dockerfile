# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7

# Barynt — production image, following Next.js's own recommended Docker
# pattern (`output: "standalone"`, see next.config.ts): the runtime stage
# ships only next's traced, pruned node_modules + build output, not the
# full dependency tree. Final image: ~460MB (measured), vs. ~1.5GB for a
# full-node_modules image without standalone output.
#
# Multi-arch by construction: every stage is built FROM oven/bun, which
# Bun publishes as a real multi-platform manifest (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64).
# Build natively for both with:
#
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t barynt:latest --push .
#
# No cross-compilation tricks (no --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM) are used on
# purpose: `bun install` must run *for the target platform* so it resolves
# the correct native optional deps (@next/swc-*, @img/sharp-*) for that arch.
# buildx already takes care of that — one native (or emulated) build per
# platform — as long as the Dockerfile doesn't force a fixed platform itself.
#
# Getting standalone output to actually work here took two explicit
# `outputFileTracingIncludes` entries in next.config.ts — without them,
# Next's automatic file tracing (@vercel/nft) drops the generated Prisma
# client and the hash-named node_modules symlinks that work around the
# Turbopack+Bun externals bug (scripts/fix-turbopack-bun-externals.ts),
# and the standalone server crashes on its first request. See the comment
# there for why.
#
# `prisma migrate deploy` deliberately does NOT run from the runtime image:
# the `prisma` CLI package drags in ~200MB of engine binaries (schema
# engine, Prisma Studio) that the running app itself never needs — it only
# ever talks to Postgres through `@prisma/client` + the `pg` driver adapter,
# no engine binary involved. Migrations instead run once from the `builder`
# stage, which already has the full toolchain (see docker-compose.yml's
# `migrate` service, `build.target: builder`, behind the "app" profile).

# reachable from the host (its published-port NAT target happens to
# resolve the same way) but NOT from 127.0.0.1 inside the container
